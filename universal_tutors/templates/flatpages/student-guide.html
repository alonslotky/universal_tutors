            <p class="lead">First up, you need to sign up to Universal Tutors. Creating a student account takes approximately 2 minutes. All that is required are your basic details such as name, age, gender and a profile picture. Credit can be uploaded to your account either at this stage or just prior to a class occurring.</p>

            <h4>Check Out the Class</h4>
            <p>We give you 5 minutes at the start of a class to check that the tutor is right for you and that you are getting exactly what you want. If for any reason you are not happy you can cancel the class at this stage at no cost.</p>

            <h4>Video / Audio Chat</h4>
            <p>For each class you will have the option of using either Video or simply Audio to communicate. All you require is a functioning microphone for the latter and a webcam in addition for the former.</p>

            <h4>Instant Messenger</h4>

            <h4>File Sharing</h4>
            <p>Tutors and students are able to upload any file* or URL snapshot to the classroom and open them in the whiteboard. This enables tutors to use material such as exam papers or syllabuses to help facilitate an effective class.</p>

            <h4>The Whiteboard</h4>
            <p>This is the area where the class really takes place. Tutors and students can interact using shapes, text, drawing, mathematical equations and even an educational search engine (Wolfram Alpha).</p>

            <h4>Wolfram Alpha</h4>
            <p>This new feature brings this leading educational search (answer) engine right into the classroom. This resource is another example of why Universal Tutors is the only choice for private tuition.</p>
