            	<h4>Check Out the Class</h4>
            	<p>We give you 60 minutes with which to familiarise yourself with the classroom on your own. Then at the beginning of each real class, students are given a short grace period to check that they are happy with their choice of tutor. If for any reason they aren't, they can cancel the class at this stage at no cost</p>

            	<p>For each class you will have the option of using either Video or simply Audio to communicate. All you require is a functioning microphone for the latter and a webcam in addition for the former.</p>

	            <p>Tutors and students are able to upload any file* or URL snapshot to the classroom and open them in the whiteboard. This enables tutors to use material such as exam papers or syllabuses to help facilitate an effective class.</p>

	            <p>This is the area where the class really takes place. Tutors and students can interact using shapes, text, drawing, mathematical equations and even an educational search engine (Wolfram Alpha).</p>

	            <p>This new feature brings this leading educational search (answer) engine right into the classroom. This resource is another example of why Universal Tutors is the only choice for private tuition.</p>
