            <h3>The Company</h3>
            <p class="lead">At its heart, the name Wizoku stems from our desire to create something new. The name itself is a hybrid word that combines "wisdom" and "zoku," which is a Japanese suffix for a group or community with shared interests. What we've done at Wizoku is create an active community of people who share the same understanding of education's importance. Join us today!</p>
