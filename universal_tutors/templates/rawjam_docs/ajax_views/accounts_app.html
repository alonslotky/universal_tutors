    <h4>django-allauth</h4>
    
    <p>We have forked the django-allauth app, which provides both standard and social signin and signup (registration). We are actively building upon this foundation to add additional profile management functionality. As such, please speak with your Project Manager if you think you need to make changes to this core app, so that we can either give you access to the git fork or implement the changes ourselves. You can test a couple of the most obvious views below:</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/accounts/login/">Login</a></li>
        <li><a href="/accounts/signup/">Register</a></li>
    </ul>
