    <li>
        <b>I've create a brand new app in the apps/ folder (i.e. apps/someapp)</b><br/>
        run 'sh manage schemamigration someapp --initial';<br/>
        run 'sh manage migrate someapp';

        There is a chance that it will error if you have defined custom fields that are unknown to South. To resolve this, simply follow the instructions here http://south.aeracode.org/wiki/MyFieldsDontWork
